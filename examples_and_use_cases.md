# Examples and Use Cases for Agentic AI Frameworks

This section provides examples and use cases for each agentic AI framework. Each example includes detailed descriptions and code snippets to help you understand how to use these frameworks in real-world scenarios.

## General Agentic AI Frameworks

# Initialize LangChain
lc = LangChain()

# Add a language model
lc.add_model("gpt-3")

# Create a chain
chain = lc.create_chain(["Hello, how can I help you today?"])

# Run the chain
response = chain.run()
print(response)
```

#### Use Case: Data Analysis
LangChain can be used to create tools for analyzing and interpreting large datasets using LLMs. For example, you can build an application that analyzes customer feedback and generates insights.
